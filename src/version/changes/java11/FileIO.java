        Likewise, for writing a lot of content that may not be present in memory all at once, you use Files::write by passing it an Iterable<String>.
        But what about the easy case where you can handle the entire content as a simple string?
        That hasnâ€™t been terribly convenient because Files::readAllBytes and the matching overload for Files::write operate with byte arrays.
        If need be, you can also pass a CharSet to readString and OpenOptions to writeString.

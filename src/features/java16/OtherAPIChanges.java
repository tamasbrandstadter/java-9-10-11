// The DateTimeFormatterBuilder class has a new method, appendDayPeriodText().
// This provides a way of formatting the time of day as “in the morning”, “in the afternoon”, etc. rather than just AM or PM.
// ByteBuffer, CharBuffer, DoubleBuffer, FloatBuffer, IntBuffer, LongBuffer and ShortBuffer all have a new put() method.
// These methods copy a defined length section of a second buffer, starting at a given offset in that buffer to a specified index
// in the buffer that the method is being called on.  That description seems complicated, but it is a simple replacement for the loop.
